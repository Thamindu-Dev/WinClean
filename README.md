## üìù What Gets Cleaned

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `C:\Windows\Temp` | System-wide temporary files |
| `C:\Windows\Prefetch` | Application prefetch data |
| `%TEMP%` | Current user's temporary files |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Script Won't Run
- Ensure you have administrator privileges
- Check if your antivirus is blocking the script
- Verify that batch file execution is not disabled by group policy

### "Access Denied" Errors
